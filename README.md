# Twitter_test

Just test application for job interview

## What's wrong here:

+ Each time the application authorization token is received
+ Ignores service level errors
+ Bad mapping solution from JSON to POCO
+ No pagination
+ Without third party frameworks(except SDWebImage)
+ Single Data model through all layers
+ SDWebImage for image caching
+ Settings Screen very simple, without beautiful TableView with static data
+ No localization, all strings hardcoded into view layer
+ AppState not covered by interface
+ Very simple subscription logic with AppState changes for cells
